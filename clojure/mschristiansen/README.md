# HollingBerries Solution in Clojure

A solution in Clojure.

## Usage

You'll need [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen), a
build tool for Clojure.

Leiningen will fetch project dependencies described in the project.clj
file.
> lein deps

Allows you to run the program, which will generate the pricefile.txt.
> lein run

Or start a repl (is it called a prompt in Python?)
> lein repl

To run the test:
> lein test

UPDATE:
I wasn't quite happy with first version and have done a second, which
is now available in the namespace 'berry.second - it's slightly shorter
and data is nicely separated from the program.
