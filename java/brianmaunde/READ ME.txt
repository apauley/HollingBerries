/*
 *This is a semi-modularized implementation of the problem written with different
 * custom implementations in mind. Implementation in here can easily be replaced 
 * though they procedure based rather than object oriented using interfaces.
 * 
 * However, it works well as the implementations would be direct code refactoring
 * in the methods of this class.
 * 
 * APIs to do some of the stuff written in a custom way here were not used due
 * to the fact that I also wanted to see how huge and difficult some of the 
 * activities are and in how much code this could be done - mainly in a custom 
 * manner. Also to reduce dependencies when testing this code. This piece of code 
 * can be executed without depending on any external libraries/APIs.
