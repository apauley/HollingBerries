Introduction
============

This is the Xtend implementation of the HollingBerries problem. Now I know you're rolling 
your eyes thinking: "Oh gawd, another obscure language I've never heard of!", but hold on 
a sec and hear me out. Xtend is not like your other typical languages. Here are the highlights:

* Xtend is essentially a pre-processor for Java. So it compiles the code to Java source files, 
  which are then compiled by the Java compiler.

* Java source is valid Xtend source. This means Xtend is simply additions to the Java language to 
  make it prettier and more functional.

* The learning curve is thus not steep. You simply use the bits of Xtend that make things easier for you.

* Xtend is an Eclipse project and thus has deep Eclipse integration and tooling support. You can even debug 
  Xtend code by stepping through Xtend code.

How to run this Xtend version
=============================

* Install Eclipse and Xtend. See here for details: http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/#download

* Import the project into Eclipse (File > Import > Existing projects into workspace)

* Hit the "Run" button. You won't see any output in the console.

* Check that the pricefile.txt output was created in the project root

* Verify test passed by running this in the command-line from the project root: 
    
    > $ diff -u ../../pricefile.txt pricefile.txt # Expect no output


About the Code
==============

This is a similar implementation to my Ruby implementation, but instead of the elaborate config data, I used the 
powerful switch functionality of Xtend to map the product codes to markups and sell_by dates. Also, unlike the Ruby 
version, as is common in Java, I created a data object to hold the CSV data. This allows code-completion and other 
advantages of statically-typed languages to come through.
